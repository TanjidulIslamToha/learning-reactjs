## 🎯 How to Use

1. **Read through each guide** - Understand the principles
2. **Apply to your code** - Use these practices in your projects
3. **Reference when needed** - Come back when you have questions
4. **Keep updated** - Add new patterns as you discover them

## 💡 Quick Reference

### Essential Rules
- ✅ Always use functional components
- ✅ Use hooks for state and side effects
- ✅ Keep components small and focused
- ✅ Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- ✅ Use meaningful names
- ✅ Handle errors gracefully
- ✅ Optimize re-renders
- ✅ Write accessible code

### Avoid
- ❌ Mutating state directly
- ❌ Creating components inside render
- ❌ Using index as key when items can reorder
- ❌ Forgetting cleanup in useEffect
- ❌ Prop drilling (use Context instead)
- ❌ Over-optimizing prematurely

## 📖 Learning Path

If you're learning React, follow this order:
1. Start with `component-structure.md`
2. Learn `naming-conventions.md`
3. Master `state-management.md`
4. Study `props-patterns.md`
5. Explore advanced patterns as needed

## 🔄 Keep Updated

As React evolves and you learn new patterns:
- Add new best practices you discover
- Update existing practices with new insights
- Share patterns that work well for your team
- Document anti-patterns you encounter

**Remember:** Best practices are guidelines, not strict rules. Use your judgment and adapt to your project's needs!
